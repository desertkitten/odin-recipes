    </p>
    <p>This can also be made into 24 standard-sized muffins. Set a timer for 15 minutes and check frequently until done when baking.</p>
    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>

            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>

            <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese</li>

            <li>1 large egg</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>2 cups fresh blueberries</li>

            <li>¼ cup turbinado sugar (such as Sugar in the Raw®) (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with extra-large paper cupcake liners.</li>

            <li>Beat white sugar, butter, and lemon zest together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in ricotta cheese, followed by egg, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.</li>

            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into butter mixture until just combined; batter will be thick. Carefully fold in blueberries.</li>

            <li>Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of turbinado sugar over each muffin.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden on top and a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out mostly clean with some crumbs, 26 to 28 minutes. Remove muffins from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool, 15 to
                20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
